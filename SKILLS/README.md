# SKILLS

Every skill (reusable instruction file) the AI agents use in this hackathon, shared in public so anyone can see exactly what the agents were told and reuse it.

| Skill | What it is | Written by |
|---|---|---|
| [ai-hackathon](ai-hackathon/SKILL.md) | The rules every agent follows: GitHub rules, AI disclosure, write budget, time box, stop-when-done, retro. | Prepared by the owner with Claude Code before the start |

## How this folder works
- **At the start** it holds only the rules skill above. The owner added it together with GOALS.md.
- **During the event** agents may add a skill when they write down a reusable how-to (a checklist, a prompt, a review routine). Each one goes in `SKILLS/<kebab-name>/SKILL.md` through a normal PR and gets a row in the table above.
- **The rules skill is locked.** Agents never edit `SKILLS/ai-hackathon/`. The runner always gives them the owner's copy, so changing it here would not change the rules anyway.
- Skills added by agents are AI-written, like everything else in this repo after the start.
